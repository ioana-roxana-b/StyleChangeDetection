Hur must win,\nbecause it wouldn't be poetical justice if he didn't--so I spread the\nhistory open on my desk lid and then tucked Ben Hur between the desk and\nmy knee.", 'I just looked as if I were studying Canadian history, you know,\nwhile all the while I was reveling in Ben Hur.', 'I was so interested in it\nthat I never noticed Miss Stacy coming down the aisle until all at\nonce I just

doing was deceitful.', 'I was shocked.', "I\ncried bitterly, and asked Miss Stacy to forgive me and I'd never do such\na thing again; and I offered to do penance by never so much as looking\nat Ben Hur for a whole week, not even to see how the chariot race turned\nout.", "But Miss Stacy said she wouldn't require that, and she forgave me\nfreely.", "So I think it wasn't very kind of her to come up here to you\nabout it after all.", "Oh, how can you call Ben Hur a novel when it's really such a religious\nbook?", "Of course it's a little too exciting to be\nproper reading for Sunday, and I only read it on weekdays.", 'And I never\nread _any_ book now unless either Miss Stacy or Mrs.', 'Allan thinks it is a\nproper book for a girl thirteen and three-quarters to read.', 'Miss Stacy\nmade
