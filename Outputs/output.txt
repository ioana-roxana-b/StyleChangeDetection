and her behavior": 38, "What was more, she showed and read to\neveryone the letter in Dounia's own handwriting to Mr": 17, 'Svidrigaïlov and\neven allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think was\nsuperfluous': 17, 'In this way she was busy for several days in driving about\nthe whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence\nhaving been given to others': 28, "And therefore they had to take turns, so\nthat in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone\nknew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the\nletter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading\nof it, even many who had heard it several times already both in their\nown houses and in other people's": 67, "In my opinion a great deal, a very\ngreat deal of all this was unnecessary; but that's Marfa Petrovna's\ncharacter": 20, "Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounia's\nreputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible\ndisgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I really\nbegan to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too\nharshly": 48, 'Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families,\nbut she refused': 14, 'All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked\nrespect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may\nsay, our whole fortunes are now transformed': 33, 'You must know, dear Rodya,\nthat Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry\nhim': 19, 'I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been\narranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved\nwith me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we\ncould not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you': 54, 'And you\ncould not have judged all the facts without being on the spot': 14, 'This\nwas how it happened': 5, 'He is already of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr\nPetrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who\nhas been very active in bringing the match about': 29, 'It began with his\nexpressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance': 13, 'He was\nproperly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent\nus a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a\nspeedy and decided answer': 34, 'He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry\nto get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him': 24, 'At first,\nof course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly\nand unexpectedly': 17, 'We thought and talked it over the whole day': 9, 'He is a\nwell-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government\nand has already made his fortune': 22, 'It is true that he is forty-five years\nold, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be\nthought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and\npresentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited': 44, 'But possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight': 13, 'And beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will\ndo, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if\nthere is anything you do not like in him at first sight': 39, 'I give you this\nwarning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression\nupon you': 18, 'Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be\ndeliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas,\nwhich are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards': 30, 'And Pyotr\nPetrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man': 12, "At his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but\nstill he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions ‘of our\nmost rising generation' and he is an opponent of all prejudices": 39, 'He\nsaid a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be\nlistened to, but this is scarcely a vice': 24, 'I, of course, understood very\nlittle of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man\nof great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured': 31, "You know\nyour sister's character, Rodya": 6, 'She is a resolute, sensible, patient and\ngenerous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know very well': 20, 'Of course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, but\nDounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make\nit her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her\nhappiness his care': 48, 'Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though it\nmust be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste': 22, 'Besides he\nis a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, that\nhis own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with\nhim': 32, 'And as for some defects of character, for some habits and even\ncertain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even in\nthe happiest marriages--Dounia has said that, as regards all that, she\nrelies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and\nthat she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future\nrelationship can be an honourable and straightforward one': 67, 'He struck me,\nfor instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come\nfrom his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is': 29, "For\ninstance, at his second visit, after he had received Dounia's consent,\nin the course of conversation, he declared that before making\nDounia's acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of\ngood reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced\npoverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his\nwife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her\nbenefactor": 77, 'I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely\nthan I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only\nremember the meaning': 27, 'And, besides, it was obviously not said of design,\nbut slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwards\nto correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike\nme as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia': 47, "But Dounia was\nvexed, and answered that ‘words are not deeds,' and that, of course, is\nperfectly true": 18, 'Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up\nher mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and was\nwalking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before\nthe ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me\nthat she had decided': 57, '"I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for\nPetersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to open\na legal bureau': 29, 'He has been occupied for many years in conducting civil\nand commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an important\ncase': 23, 'He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case before\nthe Senate': 15, 'So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in\nevery way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day\nyou could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that\nyour future is marked out and assured for you': 47, 'Oh, if only this comes to\npass': 7, 'This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a\nprovidential blessing': 17, 'Dounia is dreaming of nothing else': 6, 'We have even\nventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch': 16, 'He was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could not\nget on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to\na relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for the\nduties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted': 55, ') but then\nhe expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave\nyou time for work at his office': 21, 'The matter dropped for the time, but\nDounia is thinking of nothing else now': 14, "She has been in a sort of fever\nfor the last few days, and has already made a regular plan for\nyour becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr\nPetrovitch's business, which might well be, seeing that you are a\nstudent of law": 48, 'I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and share\nall her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of\nrealising them': 24, "And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitch's evasiveness, very\nnatural at present (since he does not know you), Dounia is firmly\npersuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her\nfuture husband; this she is reckoning upon": 39, 'Of course we are careful\nnot to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch,\nespecially of your becoming his partner': 24, 'He is a practical man and might\ntake this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream': 20, 'Nor\nhas either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have\nof his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken\nof it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself,\nlater on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of\nhimself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily since\nyou may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, and\nreceive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your\nown work': 102, 'Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree\nwith her': 14, 'And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, that\nis, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when\nyou first meet him': 29, 'When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about\nyou, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing\nhim close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own\nopinion when he makes your acquaintance': 40, 'Do you know, my precious\nRodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with Pyotr\nPetrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish,\nfancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with\nthem, after the wedding': 45, 'I am convinced that he will be generous and\ndelicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter\nfor the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it is\nsimply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse': 49, "I have\nnoticed more than once in my life that husbands don't quite get on with\ntheir mothers-in-law, and I don't want to be the least bit in anyone's\nway, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so\nlong as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and\nDounia": 60, 'If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most\njoyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter:\nknow then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a\nvery short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of\nalmost three years': 56, "It is settled _for certain_ that Dounia and I are to\nset off for Petersburg, exactly when I don't know, but very, very soon,\npossibly in a week": 28, 'It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us\nknow when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg': 22, 'To suit his\nown arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible,\neven before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that is\ntoo soon to be ready, immediately after': 39, 'Oh, with what happiness I shall\npress you to my heart': 11, 'Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought\nof seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry\nPyotr Petrovitch for that alone': 29, 'She is an angel': 4, 'She is not writing\nanything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much,\nso much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, for\na few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting\nherself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses': 61, 'But\nalthough we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as much\nmoney as I can in a day or two': 24, 'Now that everyone has heard that Dounia\nis to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has suddenly improved and I know\nthat Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles\non the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to send\nyou twenty-five or even thirty roubles': 52, "I would send you more, but I am\nuneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has\nbeen so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, that\nis to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big\ntrunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his), we\nmust reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where we\ncan't be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days": 83, 'But\nwe have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we see\nthat the journey will not cost very much': 24, 'It is only ninety versts from\nus to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we\nknow, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travel\nquite comfortably third class': 40, 'So that I may very likely be able to send\nto you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles': 17, 'But enough; I have covered\ntwo sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole\nhistory, but so many events have happened': 25,

flat as bare as the hand, not\neven a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a dark\nblur on the very edge of the horizon': 37, 'A few paces beyond the last market\ngarden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a\nfeeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with his father': 35, 'There was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse,\nhideous hoarse singing and often fighting': 17, 'Drunken and horrible-looking\nfigures were hanging about the tavern': 9, 'He used to cling close to his\nfather, trembling all over when he met them': 15, 'Near the tavern the road\nbecame a dusty track, the dust of which was always black': 16, 'It was a\nwinding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to the\nright to the graveyard': 20, 'In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone\nchurch with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three\ntimes a year with his father and mother, when a service was held in\nmemory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had never\nseen': 53, 'On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a\ntable napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in\nthe shape of a cross': 34, 'He loved that church, the old-fashioned, unadorned\nikons and the old priest with the shaking head': 16, "Near his grandmother's\ngrave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave of his younger\nbrother who had died at six months old": 25, 'He did not remember him at all,\nbut he had been told about his little brother, and whenever he visited\nthe graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and\nto bow down and kiss the little grave': 39, "And now he dreamt that he was\nwalking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he\nwas holding his father's hand and looking with dread at the tavern": 33, 'A\npeculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to be\nsome kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressed\ntownspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts,\nall singing and all more or less drunk': 40, 'Near the entrance of the tavern\nstood a cart, but a strange cart': 13, 'It was one of those big carts usually\ndrawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy\ngoods': 22, 'He always liked looking at those great cart-horses, with their\nlong manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect\nmountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going\nwith a load than without it': 40, "But now, strange to say, in the shafts of\nsuch a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasants'\nnags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load\nof wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in\na rut": 53, 'And the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even\nabout the nose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them that\nhe almost cried, and his mother always used to take him away from the\nwindow': 40, 'All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singing\nand the balalaïka, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken\npeasants came out, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over\ntheir shoulders': 40, '"Get in, get in': 4, '" shouted one of them, a young thick-necked peasant with\na fleshy face red as a carrot': 17, '"I\'ll take you all, get in': 6, '"\n\nBut at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the\ncrowd': 15, '"Take us all

('DOS CHAPTER V PART IV', {"When next morning at eleven o'clock punctually Raskolnikov went into the\ndepartment of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his name in\nto Porfiry Petrovitch, he

to prevent his escape': 26, 'But there was\nnothing of the sort: he saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty\ndetails, then other people, no one seemed to have any concern with him': 30, 'He might go where he liked for them': 8, 'The conviction grew stronger in him\nthat if that enigmatic man of yesterday, that phantom sprung out of the\nearth, had seen everything, they would not have let

trembling--and he felt a\nrush of indignation at the thought that he was trembling with fear at\nfacing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch': 40, 'What he dreaded above all was\nmeeting that man again; he hated him with an intense, unmitigated hatred\nand was afraid his hatred might betray him': 26, 'His indignation was such\nthat he ceased trembling at once; he made ready to go in with a cold and\narrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep as silent as possible,\nto watch and listen and for once at least to control his overstrained\nnerves': 46, 'At that moment he was summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch': 9, 'He found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his study': 8, 'His study was a room\nneither large nor small, furnished with a large writing-table, that\nstood before a sofa,

into such a guffaw that he turned almost crimson, Raskolnikov's\nrepulsion overcame all precaution; he left off laughing, scowled and\nstared with hatred at Porfiry, keeping his eyes fixed on him while his\nintentionally prolonged laughter lasted": 53, "There was lack of precaution on\nboth sides, however, for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be laughing in\nhis visitor's face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with\nwhich the visitor received it": 35, "The latter fact was very significant\nin Raskolnikov's eyes: he saw that Porfiry Petrovitch had not been\nembarrassed just before either, but that he, Raskolnikov, had perhaps\nfallen into a trap; that there must be something, some motive here\nunknown to him; that, perhaps, everything was in readiness and in\nanother moment would break upon him": 56, 'He went straight to the point at once, rose from his seat and took his\ncap': 16, '"Porfiry Petrovitch," he began resolutely, though with considerable\nirritation,

twenty roubles, given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladov's\nfuneral, were wasted upon it": 16, 'Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to\nhonour the memory of the deceased "suitably," that all the lodgers,\nand still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know "that he was in no way their\ninferior, and perhaps very much their superior," and that no one had the\nright "to turn up his nose at him': 52, '" Perhaps the chief element was that\npeculiar "poor man\'s pride," which compels many poor people to spend\ntheir last savings on some traditional social ceremony, simply in order\nto do "like other people," and not to "be looked down upon': 41, '" It is very\nprobable, too, that Katerina Ivanovna longed on this occasion, at\nthe moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone, to show those\n"wretched contemptible lodgers" that she knew "how to do things, how\nto entertain" and that she had been brought up "in a genteel, she might\nalmost say aristocratic colonel\'s family" and had not been meant for\nsweeping floors and washing the children\'s rags at night': 72, 'Even the\npoorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to these\nparoxysms of pride and vanity

Amalia Ivanovna who,\nquarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn the whole\nfamily out of doors, had shouted at her that they "were not worth the\nfoot" of the honourable lodgers whom

certificate of honour of\nwhich Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov in the tavern, when he told\nhim that Katerina Ivanovna, his wife, had danced the shawl dance\nbefore the governor and other great personages on leaving school': 49, 'This\ncertificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove Katerina\nIvanovna\'s right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed herself\nwith it chiefly with the object of overwhelming "those two stuck-up\ndraggletails" if they came to the dinner, and proving incontestably\nthat Katerina Ivanovna was of the most noble, "she might even say\naristocratic family, a colonel\'s daughter and was far superior to\ncertain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore of late': 77, '" The\ncertificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of the drunken\nguests, and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to retain it, for it actually\ncontained the statement _en toutes lettres_, that her father was of the\nrank of a major, and also a companion of an order, so that she really\nwas almost the daughter of a colonel': 60, 'Warming up, Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and\nhappy life they would lead in T----, on the gymnasium teachers whom\nshe would engage to give lessons in her boarding-school, one a most\nrespectable old Frenchman, one Mangot, who had taught Katerina Ivanovna\nherself in old days and was still living in T----, and would no doubt\nteach in her school on moderate terms': 66, 'Next she spoke of Sonia who would\ngo with her to T---- and help her in all her plans': 19, 'At this someone at\nthe further end of the table gave a sudden guffaw': 14, 'Though Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of\nit, she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction of\nSonia\'s undoubted ability to assist her, of "her gentleness, patience,\ndevotion, generosity and good education," tapping Sonia on the cheek and\nkissing her warmly twice': 49, 'Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina Ivanovna\nsuddenly burst into tears, immediately observing that she was "nervous\nand silly, that she was too much upset, that it was time to finish, and\nas the dinner was over, it was time to hand round the tea': 44, '"\n\nAt that moment, Amalia Ivanovna, deeply aggrieved at taking no part in\nthe conversation, and not being listened to, made one last effort,\nand with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty\nobservation, that "in the future boarding-school she would have to pay\nparticular attention to _die Wäsche_, and that there certainly

omit\nthe smallest detail': 20, "He explained every incident of the murder, the\nsecret of _the pledge_ (the piece of wood with a strip of metal) which\nwas found in the murdered woman's hand": 29, "He described minutely how he\nhad taken her keys, what they were like, as well as the chest and its\ncontents; he explained the mystery of Lizaveta's murder; described how\nKoch and, after him, the student knocked, and repeated all they had said\nto one another; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay\nand Dmitri shouting; how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards\ngone

lawyers and the\njudges were very much struck, among other things, by the fact that he\nhad hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, without making\nuse of them, and that, what was more, he did not now remember what the\ntrinkets were like, or even how many there were': 53, 'The fact that he had\nnever opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed\nincredible': 21, 'There turned out to be in the purse three hundred and\nseventeen roubles and sixty copecks': 16, 'From being so long under the stone,\nsome of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the\ndamp': 20, 'They were a long while trying to discover why the accused man\nshould tell a lie about this, when about everything else he had made\na truthful and straightforward confession': 30, "Finally some of the lawyers\nmore versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really\nnot looked into the purse, and so didn't know what was in it when he\nhid it under the stone": 37, 'But they immediately drew the deduction that\nthe crime could only have been committed through temporary mental\nderangement, through homicidal mania, without object or the pursuit of\ngain': 28, 'This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary\ninsanity, so often applied in our days in criminal cases': 21, "Moreover\nRaskolnikov's hypochondriacal condition was proved by many

decisive question\nas to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery, he\nanswered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was\nhis miserable position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire to\nprovide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand\nroubles he had reckoned on finding': 59, 'He had been led to the murder\nthrough his shallow and cowardly nature, exasperated moreover by\nprivation and failure': 19, 'To the question what led him to confess, he\nanswered that it was his heartfelt repentance': 16, 'All this was almost\ncoarse': 5, 'The sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected,\nperhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself,\nbut had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt': 32, 'All the strange\nand peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration': 13, 'There could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition\nof the criminal at the time': 17, 'The fact that he had made no use of what he\nhad stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse, partly to his\nabnormal mental condition at the time of the crime': 34, 'Incidentally the\nmurder of Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a man\ncommits two murders and forgets that the door is open': 24, 'Finally, the\nconfession, at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by\nthe false evidence given by Nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism,\nand when, moreover, there were no proofs against the real criminal, no\nsuspicions even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word)--all this did\nmuch to soften the sentence': 51, "Other circumstances, too, in the prisoner's\nfavour came out quite unexpectedly": 11, 'Razumihin somehow discovered and\nproved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor\nconsumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting\nhim for six months, and when this student died, leaving a decrepit\nold father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year,\nRaskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral\nwhen he died': 68, "Raskolnikov's landlady bore witness, too, that when they\nhad lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskolnikov had rescued two\nlittle children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so": 33,

at the same time\nto see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible': 36, "Pulcheria Alexandrovna's\nillness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial\nderangement of her intellect": 18, 'When Dounia returned from her last interview with her brother, she\nhad found her mother already ill, in feverish delirium': 20, "That evening\nRazumihin and she agreed what answers they must make to her mother's\nquestions about Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her\nmother's benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of Russia\non a business commission, which would bring him in the end money and\nreputation": 53, 'But they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna never\nasked them anything on the subject, neither then nor thereafter': 21, "On the\ncontrary, she had her own version of her son's sudden departure; she\ntold them with tears how he had come to say good-bye to her, hinting\nthat she alone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that Rodya\nhad many very powerful enemies, so that it was necessary for him to be\nin hiding": 56, 'As for his future career, she had no doubt that it would be\nbrilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed': 21, 'She assured\nRazumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman, that his\narticle and brilliant literary talent proved it': 22, 'This article she was\ncontinually reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to bed\nwith her, but scarcely asked where Rodya was, though the subject was\nobviously avoided by the others, which might have been enough to awaken\nher suspicions': 42, "They began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovna's strange\nsilence on certain subjects": 15, 'She did not, for instance, complain of\ngetting no letters from him, though in previous years she had only lived\non the hope of letters from her beloved Rodya': 29, "This was the cause of\ngreat uneasiness to Dounia; the idea occurred to her that her mother\nsuspected that there was something terrible in her son's fate and was\nafraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still more awful": 40, 'In any\ncase, Dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of\nher faculties': 17, 'It happened once or twice, however, that Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave\nsuch a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her\nwithout mentioning where Rodya was, and on receiving unsatisfactory and\nsuspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent, and this mood\nlasted for a long time': 50, 'Dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive\nher and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely\nsilent on certain points; but it became more and more evident that\nthe poor mother suspected something terrible': 41, "Dounia remembered her\nbrother's telling her that her mother had overheard her talking in her\nsleep on the night after her interview with Svidrigaïlov and before the\nfatal day of the confession: had not she made out something from that": 40, 'Sometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be\nsucceeded by a period of hysterical animation, and the invalid would\nbegin to talk almost incessantly of her son, of her hopes of his\nfuture': 37, 'Her fancies were sometimes very strange': 6, 'They humoured her,\npretended to agree with her (she saw perhaps that they were pretending),\nbut she still went on talking': 21, "Five months after Raskolnikov's confession, he was sentenced": 8, 'Razumihin\nand Sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible': 13, 'At last\nthe moment of separation came': 7, 'Dounia swore to her brother that the\nseparation should not be for ever, Razumihin did the same': 17, 'Razumihin, in\nhis youthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least\nof a secure livelihood during the next three or four years, and saving\nup a certain sum, to emigrate to Siberia, a country rich in every\nnatural resource and in need of workers, active men and capital': 51, 'There\nthey would settle in the town where Rodya was and all together would\nbegin a new life': 18, 'They all wept at parting': 5, 'Raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before': 10, 'He asked a great\ndeal about his mother and was constantly anxious about her': 14, 'He worried\nso much about her that it alarmed Dounia': 10, "When he heard about his\nmother's illness he became very gloomy": 11, 'With Sonia he was particularly\nreserved all the time': 9, 'With the help of the money left to her by\nSvidrigaïlov, Sonia had long ago made her preparations to follow the\nparty of convicts in which he was despatched to Siberia': 31, 'Not a word\npassed between Raskolnikov and her on the subject, but both knew it\nwould be so': 18, "At the final leave-taking he smiled strangely at his\nsister's and Razumihin's fervent anticipations of their happy future\ntogether when he should come out of prison": 26, "He predicted that their\nmother's illness would soon have a fatal ending": 12, 'Sonia and he at last\nset off': 7, 'Two months later Dounia was married to Razumihin': 8, 'It was a quiet

carrying out his plans and indeed she\ncould not but believe in him': 19, 'He displayed a rare strength of will': 7, 'Among other things he began attending university lectures again in order\nto take his degree': 15, 'They were continually making plans for the future;\nboth counted on settling in Siberia within five years at least': 19, 'Till\nthen they rested their hopes on Sonia': 8, "Pulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to Dounia's\nmarriage with Razumihin; but after the marriage she became even more\nmelancholy and anxious": 24, 'To give her pleasure Razumihin told her how\nRaskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father\nand how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing two\nlittle children from a fire': 38, "These two pieces of news excited Pulcheria\nAlexandrovna's disordered imagination almost to ecstasy": 13, 'She was\ncontinually talking about them, even entering into conversation with\nstrangers in the street, though Dounia always accompanied her': 20, 'In public\nconveyances and shops, wherever she could capture a listener, she would\nbegin the discourse about her son, his article, how he had helped the\nstudent, how he had been burnt at the fire, and so on': 38, 'Dounia did\nnot know how to restrain her': 8, "Apart from the danger of her morbid\nexcitement, there was the risk of someone's recalling Raskolnikov's name\nand speaking of the recent trial": 23, 'Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out the\naddress of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted\non going to see her': 24, 'At last her restlessness reached an extreme point': 8, 'She would sometimes\nbegin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious': 14, 'One\nmorning she declared that by her reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home,\nthat she remembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they must\nexpect him back in nine months': 34, 'She began to prepare for his coming,\nbegan to do up her room for him, to clean the furniture, to wash and\nput up new hangings and so on': 29, 'Dounia was anxious, but said nothing and\nhelped her to arrange the room': 13, 'After a fatiguing day spent in continual\nfancies, in joyful day-dreams and tears, Pulcheria Alexandrovna was\ntaken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious': 29, 'It was brain fever': 4, 'She died within a fortnight': 5, "In her delirium she\ndropped words which showed that she knew a great deal more about her\nson's terrible fate than they had supposed": 24, "For a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his mother's death, though\na regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached\nSiberia": 25, 'It was carried on by means of Sonia, who wrote every month\nto the Razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity': 22, "At\nfirst they found Sonia's letters dry and unsatisfactory, but later on\nthey came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better, for\nfrom these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate\nbrother's life": 38, "Sonia's letters were full of the most matter-of-fact\ndetail, the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikov's\nsurroundings as a convict": 21, 'There was no word of her own hopes, no\nconjecture as to the future, no description of her feelings': 19, 'Instead of\nany attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life, she gave the\nsimple facts--that is, his own words, an exact account of his health,\nwhat he asked for at their interviews, what commission he gave her\nand so on': 43, 'All these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness': 8, 'The\npicture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness\nand precision': 15, 'There could be no mistake, because nothing was given but\nfacts': 11, 'But Dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news,\nespecially at first': 16, 'Sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and not\nready to talk, that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave\nhim from their letters, that he sometimes asked after his mother and\nthat when, seeing that he had guessed the truth, she told him at last\nof her death, she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly\naffected by it, not externally at any rate': 70, 'She told them that, although\nhe seemed so wrapped up in himself and, as it were, shut himself off\nfrom everyone--he took a very direct and simple view of his new life;\nthat he understood his position, expected nothing better for the time,\nhad no ill-founded hopes (as is so common in his position) and scarcely\nseemed surprised at anything in his surroundings, so unlike anything he\nhad known before': 70, 'She wrote that his health was satisfactory; he did his\nwork without shirking or seeking to do more; he was almost indifferent\nabout food, but except on Sundays and holidays the food was so bad that\nat last he had been glad to accept some money from her, Sonia, to have\nhis own tea every day': 56, 'He begged her not to trouble about anything else,\ndeclaring that all this fuss about him only annoyed him': 19, 'Sonia wrote\nfurther that in prison he shared the same room with the rest, that she\nhad not seen the inside of their barracks, but concluded that they were\ncrowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he slept on a plank bed with a\nrug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement': 53, 'But that\nhe lived so poorly and roughly, not from any plan or design, but simply\nfrom inattention and indifference': 20, 'Sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits,\nhad almost been vexed with her indeed for coming, unwilling to talk and\nrude to her': 30, 'But that in the end these visits had become a habit and\nalmost a necessity for him, so that he was positively distressed when\nshe was ill for some days and could not visit him': 35, 'She used to see him\non holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room, to which he was\nbrought for a few minutes to see her': 27, 'On working days she would go to\nsee him at work either at the workshops or at the brick kilns, or at the\nsheds on the banks of the Irtish': 30, 'About herself, Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making some\nacquaintances in the town, that she did sewing, and, as there\nwas scarcely a dressmaker in the town, she was looked upon as an\nindispensable person in many houses': 40, 'But she did not mention that the\nauthorities were, through her, interested in Raskolnikov; that his task\nwas lightened and so on': 22, 'At last the news came (Dounia had indeed noticed signs of alarm and\nuneasiness in the preceding letters) that he held aloof from everyone,\nthat his fellow prisoners did not like him, that he kept silent for days\nat a time and was becoming very pale': 46, 'In the last letter Sonia wrote\nthat he had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of\nthe hospital': 23, 'II\n\nHe was ill a long time': 7, 'But it was not the horrors of prison life, not\nthe hard labour, the bad food, the shaven head, or the patched clothes\nthat crushed him': 26, 'What did he care for all those trials and hardships': 10, 'he was even glad of the hard work': 8, 'Physically exhausted, he could at\nleast reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep': 14, 'And what was the food to\nhim--the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it': 15, 'In the past as a\nstudent he had often not had even that': 13, 'His clothes were warm and suited\nto his manner of life': 11, 'He did not even feel the fetters': 7, 'Was he ashamed\nof his shaven head and parti-coloured coat': 10, 'Before whom': 2, 'Before Sonia': 2, 'Sonia was afraid of him, how could he be ashamed before her': 12, 'And yet he\nwas ashamed even before Sonia, whom he tortured because of it with\nhis contemptuous rough manner': 19, 'But it was not his shaven head and his\nfetters he was ashamed of: his pride had been stung to the quick': 22, 'It was\nwounded pride that made him ill': 8, 'Oh, how happy he would have been if he\ncould have blamed himself': 13, 'He could have borne anything then, even\nshame and disgrace': 10, 'But he judged himself severely, and his exasperated\nconscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past, except\na simple _blunder_ which might happen to anyone': 26, 'He was ashamed just\nbecause he, Raskolnikov, had so hopelessly, stupidly come to grief\nthrough some decree of blind fate, and must humble himself and submit to\n"the idiocy" of a sentence, if he were anyhow to be at peace': 40, 'Vague and objectless anxiety in the present, and in the future a\ncontinual sacrifice leading to nothing--that was all that lay before\nhim': 23, 'And what comfort was it to him that at the end of eight years he\nwould only be thirty-two and able to begin a new life': 26, 'What had he to\nlive for': 6, 'What had he to look forward to': 7, 'Why should he strive': 4, 'To live\nin

him; he had always wanted\nmore': 14, 'Perhaps it was just because of the strength of his desires that he\nhad thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than to others': 26, 'And if only fate would have sent him repentance--burning repentance that\nwould have torn his heart and robbed him of sleep, that repentance, the\nawful agony of which brings visions of hanging or drowning': 34, 'Oh, he would\nhave been glad of it': 8, 'Tears and agonies would at least have been life': 9, 'But he did not repent of his crime': 8, 'At least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity, as

would deduce general conclusions in favor of\nthe peasantry and in confirmation of his knowing them': 51, 'Konstantin Levin\ndid not like such an attitude to the peasants': 11, 'To Konstantin

desires and tastes, but a\nlack of vital force, of what is called heart, of that impulse which\ndrives a man to choose someone out of the innumerable paths of life,\nand to care only for that one': 100, 'The better he knew his brother, the more\nhe noticed that Sergey Ivanovitch, and many other people who worked for\nthe public welfare, were not led by an impulse of the heart to care for\nthe public good, but reasoned from intellectual considerations that it\nwas a right thing to take interest in public affairs, and consequently\ntook interest in them': 61, 'Levin was confirmed in this generalization by\nobserving that his brother did not take questions affecting the public\nwelfare or the question of the immortality of the soul a bit more to\nheart than he did chess problems, or the ingenious construction of a\nnew machine': 46, 'Besides this, Konstantin Levin was not at his ease with his brother,\nbecause in summer in the country Levin was continually busy with work\non the
